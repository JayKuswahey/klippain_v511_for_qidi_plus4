# Description: Provides a custom and internal Shake&Tune Accelerometer helper that interfaces
#              with Klipper's accelerometer classes. It includes functions to start and stop
#              accelerometer measurements.
#              It also includes functions to load and save measurements from a file in a new
#              compressed format (.stdata) or from the legacy Klipper CSV files.
